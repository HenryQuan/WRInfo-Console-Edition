# WoWs Info R
WoWs Real is now WoWs Info R! It could get real-time statistics for [World of Warships](https://worldofwarships.com/) which **MAY** help you succeed in this game.
# How does it work?
WoWs Info reads the log file and parse helpful information (*PlayerName, TeamID and ShipName*) from it. 
After that, it sends requests to Wargaming API 24 times or less to get *PlayerID*. 
Then, it gets basic ship information from API with the help of ships.json. 
By using [Personal Rating](https://wows-numbers.com/personal/rating), the rating for players will be displayed.
***
WoWs Info R checks whether a battle starts every 20-30 seconds so there will be delay. 
# WoWs Info
