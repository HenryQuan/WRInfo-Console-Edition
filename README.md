# WoWs Replay & Statistics
This program will help you enabling replay function and also showing real time statistics. This time, it will get a GUI.

Server branch is for experimenting my ultimate goal, showing real time stat on your phone and get access to player's full stat with a click. This is the reason why I made WRInfo.

This approach will decrease the amount of work needed for Windows side. WoWs Info has all the data we need and it is more convenient to display data on your phone so that you wont be interrupted from the battle.

# TODO

More coming soon...
