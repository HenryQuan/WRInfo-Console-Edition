WoWs RS shows realtime player statistics of both teams (maximum 24 players) on your *phone* and it works for all modes. There are many similar and way more tools, such as [wows stats](https://github.com/wows-stats/wows-stats), [wows stats plus](https://github.com/anmonite/wows-stats-plus), [Matchmaking Monitor](https://github.com/jammin411/MatchmakingMonitor) and [RAA](https://raa.sea-group.org/). This program is heavily inspired by `Matchmaking Monitor` and it is now one of the pro features of [WoWs Info](https://github.com/HenryQuan/WoWs-Info-Origin).

Is it better than other alternatives? Absolutely not. WoWs RS is simply different and it aims to solve one major issue, dual monitor. It is not needed and you don't need to switch back to your desktop to check the stats and go back. It is on your phone and you can always see it. Here is also its limitations. Your computer and your phone must be inside the same network (hotspot is fine). For some university WiFi, it just doesn't work at all. 

Lastly, **Do not judge others simply based on their stats.**
